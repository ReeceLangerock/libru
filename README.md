## Libru - The Chingu Resource Library
https://libru1.herokuapp.com/

### What is this?
Libru is a programming resource library built to allow Chingu Campers to find, rate and review resources as well as track what courses, books, guides, etc you have completed, are working on, or want to do.

### How do I use it?
As an unregistered user you can browse the Libru archives for new resources to use, see which courses have good reviews from other Chingu Campers, or look through other user's portfolio's for inspiration for your own.

As a registered user you can do all of that, and more! Share resources you've found with your fellow campers, leave your thoughts on and review of a resource,  keep track of what you're working on, or want to take a look at.

### How can I help?
Not sure on this one, I'll get back to it. For now testing the site and submitting resources would be a huge help and I'm open to any and all suggestions on what can be improved.
